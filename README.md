# Work-Day-Scheduler

During this assignment, we needed to make a row, for all of the "working hours" of the day. Giving the user, text areas for each row, so that they could write out and plan out what they have to do for the day. We color coded hours for past, future, and present. We saved the enterred text, into the local storage, so that we are able to pull it, when the user reloads the page. We also coded it, so that it shows the current date and time, at the top of the webpage. There is a save button, with an event listener for each hour on the schedule.

I'm not exactly sure why, but the second digit of the day for the date, is appearing smaller than the rest of the text.

I used chatgpt to bugfix an issue I was having with displaying the time, I wrote day.js rather than dayjs for one of the lines of code, and it made the text not show because of the error.
